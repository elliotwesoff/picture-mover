the source folder in this directory should contain files (and files in subdirectories) that share the same name. they should be renamed before the start of the copy process.

the images in ./source/2 are unique images to those in ./source/1, but two of the three share the same name as photos in ./source/1. all photos sharing the same name shall be renamed.
